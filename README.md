# Armestrong Numbers
An Armstrong number is a number whose sum of the powers of its digits equals the number itself12. The power is determined by the number of digits in the number1. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1532. Armstrong numbers are of interest to programmers and learners of programming languages1.

What is Pig Latin?
Pig Latin is a playful language game in English where words are altered according to specific rules. It’s also known as “Igpay Atinlay.” Here are the basic rules for converting a word or string into Pig Latin:

Word Begins with a Consonant:
If the word starts with a consonant, move all the letters before the first vowel to the end of the word.
Add the suffix “ay” to the word.
Examples:
“duck” becomes “uckday”
“banana” becomes “ananabay”
“happy” becomes “appyhay”
Word Begins with a Vowel:
If the word starts with a vowel, simply add “yay” to the end of the word.
Examples:
“I” becomes “iyay”
“always” becomes “alwaysyay” or “alwaysway”
“egg” becomes “eggyay” or “eggway”
Word Begins with Consonant Clusters:
If the word has more than one consonant at the beginning (consonant clusters), add the whole sound (usually “ay”) to the end of the word.
Examples:
“store” becomes “orestay”
“smile” becomes “ilesmay”
“glove” becomes “oveglay”
Word Has No Vowel:
Pig Latin is not possible if the input word or string contains no vowel.
There must be at least one vowel in the word for it to be converted to Pig Latin.
